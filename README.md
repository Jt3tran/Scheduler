Created a project on scheduling a uni-programming operating system in Java
Simulated the FIFO, SJF, SRT, Highest Priority, and RR scheudling with and without context switching
Utilized priority queue to efficiently translate FIF algorithm to SJF
Used slicing and quantum counters to ensure round robin usage and prevent starvation.
