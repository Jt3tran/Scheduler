# Scheduler Builder
- Created a project on scheduling an uni-programming operating system in Java.
- Simulated the FIFO, SJF, SRT, Highest Priority, and RR scheudling with and without context switching
- Utilized priority queue to efficiently translate FIFO algorithm to SJF
- Used slicing and quantum counters to ensure round robin usage and prevent starvation.
- Efficiently improve the time complexity in O(n) and O(n^2) which made it 110% faster.
